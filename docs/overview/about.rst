What is GIANI?
**************

Giani is a FIJI plugin for the routine analysis of 3D cell biology image data. Implemented specifically with batch-processing in mind, GIANI is designed to:

* Read data sets in any format recognised by BioFormats
* Identify centres of nuclei using blob detection
* Segment nuclei fully, using either mcib3d or MorphoLibJ
* Segment cells
* Measure nuclear and cell morphology, together with fluorescence intensities within these regions.
* Explore results using a results browser based on the 3D RoiManager
